# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

The goal of this project is to combine everything Ihave learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas so you can see how it all works together. For this project, I started with this messy data set [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1). I imported it, used my data wrangling skills to clean it up, prepared it to be analyzed and then exported it as a clean CSV data file.

## Process

* The dataset was first explored
* Duplicated columns were erased
* Irrelevant columns were erased
* Exploration questions were proposed for analysis
* Variables that could answered proposed questions were cleaned
* A preliminary cleaned CSV was created
